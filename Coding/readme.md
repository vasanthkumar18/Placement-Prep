# CODING QUESTIONS LIST 

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-for-cracking-any-coding-interview/?ref=lbp : Try solving all these questions, most of them would be a model of these questions in OT or interviews. 

# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

1. I personally found DP to be hard, but this guy, *ADITYA VERMA made it a Cake Walk*. He has a playlist of 50 videos, but believe me, you'll improve problem solving ability to a different level. He uses HINDI in all the videos, but doesn't matter even if you are not good with it. You'll easily undestand it. You'll find DP exteremly easy, **MAKE SURE YOU WATCH ENTIRE PLAYLIST.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqowUJzG-iM&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go
