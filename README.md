### MY ADVICE
I'd say placements are 55% Work and 45% Luck. And the percentages can vary depending on the individuals and interviews. 
Never lose hope, keep doing what you're best at. Never compare your self with others. You'll see your peeps who have little to no knowledge getting placed and also talented people ending up getting rejected somehow due to some or other factors. *So, never compare with others, just keep working. You'll have your day.*

He uses HINDI in all the videos, but doesn't matter even if you are not good with it. You'll easily undestand it. You'll find DP exteremly easy, **MAKE SURE YOU WATCH ENTIRE PLAYLIST.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqowUJzG-iM&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go
