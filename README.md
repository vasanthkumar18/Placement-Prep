## ABOUT ME


## MY ADVISE
I'd say placements are 55% Work and 45% Luck. And the percentages can vary depending on the individuals and interviews. 
Never lose hope, keep doing what you're best at. Never compare your self with others. You'll see your peeps who have little to no knowledge getting placed and also talented people ending up getting rejected somehow due to some or other factors. *So, never compare with others, just keep working. You'll have your day.*

# CODING
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-for-cracking-any-coding-interview/?ref=lbp : Try solving all these questions, most of them would be a model of these questions in OT or interviews. 

2. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
I personally found DP to be hard, but this guy, ADITYA VERMA made it a Cake Walk. He has a playlist of 50 videos, but believe me, you'll improve problem solving ability to a different level. He uses HINDI in all the videos, but doesn't matter even if you are not good with it. You'll easily undestand it. You'll find DP exteremly easy, MAKE SURE YOU WATCH ENTIRE PLAYLIST.
