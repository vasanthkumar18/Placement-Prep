# MY ADVICE
I'd say placements are 55% Work and 45% Luck. And the percentages can vary depending on the individuals and interviews. 
Never lose hope, keep doing what you're best at. Never compare your self with others. You'll see your peeps who have little to no knowledge getting placed and also talented people ending up getting rejected somehow due to some or other factors. *So, never compare with others, just keep working. You'll have your day.*
</br>
1. The following are some of the things to do get a job at a product based company. 
2. Your resume will always be your question paper in a typical interview. Whatever you add in your resume, it should be something that you did or you are skilled at.

# CODING

### DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ( Special Mention )

1. I personally found DP to be hard, but this guy, *ADITYA VERMA made it a Cake Walk*. He has a playlist of 50 videos, but believe me, you'll improve problem solving ability to a different level. He uses HINDI in all the videos, but doesn't matter even if you are not good with it. You'll easily undestand it. You'll find DP exteremly easy, **MAKE SURE YOU WATCH ENTIRE PLAYLIST.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqowUJzG-iM&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go

2. The **top 20 Dynamic Programming Questions**, solve this after you're good to go. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-dynamic-programming-interview-questions/

3. You might have solved enough problems to understand the models and to increase the problem solving ability. Cross check if you can solve this questions,

4. Now if you have enough time, go to coding platforms and do random top DP questions. 

## Coding Prep
1. Follow one language apart from C inorder to code in Online Tests (called as OT) in day-to-day life. preferably, Java/C++
2. https://www.youtube.com/c/AdityaVermaTheProgrammingLord : It's important to learn concepts before directly jumping into problems. This playlist helps in learning many such concpets.</br>
  a. Sliding Window Algorithm </br>
  b. Find missing number and duplicate numbers </br>
  c. Recursion </br>
  d. Dynamic Programming </br>
  e. Heap </br>
  f. Stack </br>
  g. Binary Search </br>
  
NOTE :  Finding time complexity and space complexity are always important. 

I'm diving the coding into following concepts/ stages, whatever you call it. </br>
1. Maths
2. Puzzles
3. Arrays
4. Strings
5. Searching
6. Sorting
7. Hashing
8. Matrix Based
9. Recursion
10. Divide & Conquer
11. LinkedLists
12. Stack
13. Queue
14. Sliding Window 
15. Bit Magic
16. Binary Trees
17. Binary Search Tress (BST)
18. Heaps
19. Graphs
20. Greedy
21. Dynamic Programming : </br>
a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-dynamic-programming-interview-questions/ (In the final stage, check if you know all these questions) </br> 
b. https://medium.com/techie-delight/top-50-dynamic-programming-practice-problems-4208fed71aa3 (You might have solved many of these. Just check if you know them or not, if not solve) </br>
22. Backtracking
23. Trie 
24. Random other Ques

2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-for-cracking-any-coding-interview/?ref=lbp : Make sure you're good at solving all these questions.  Try solving all these questions, most of them would be a model of these questions in OT or interviews. 
3. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L3sbSjPdnoJLBR7vnE-AyDlSGNcd4bcEhu5Rveucpa8/edit : CODING SHEET : 3 months

So, basically either do 1/2 first, depending on your interest.

Note: I don't believe that there's a separate path to learn coding and all. It always goes down to consistency. Doing atleast a coding question daily improves your problem solving ability and the grip over syntax. But at the end, you just have to be good at all the models. 

## IMP POINTS / TRICKS
1. While solving some coding question in an interview. If it is a known question, never tell them that yeah.. I've solved this already and all. Be calm, think about it. If it is too easy, take a little amount of time and code it. If it is kind of med-high prob, go through all the logics in your mind and then code. 
2. While coding a problem, speak what's running through your mind. Let them know your thinking process. If they ask you not to speak, then you can simply write the code and discuss after finishing. 
3. Try to minimise the use of global variables
4. Even if you know the optimised solution of a problem, give them a brute force solution at first by discussing and later go on optimising and then code the optimised solution. 
5. Sometimes, few interviewers give hints. Some won't. Depends on who interviews you. Just some luck. 
6. Startups are basically strict, they hire a very few people who are extremlly skilled and pay them loads.
